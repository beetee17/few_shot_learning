To-Do (short-term)
- literature review on current FSL algorithms(s), gather points of consideration for diff algos, base class selection
- detailed explanation of concepts/techniques involved in FSL (problem statement, deep learning, siamese networks/triplet loss)
- 

To-Do (long-term)
- narrow down on rare object to be classified (especially if FSL has better results with test cases similar to base classes)
- working python script implementing a FSL algorithm with test dataset
- specify end-product (web-service?)

Completed
- confirm project topic as Few Shot Learning (FSL) for image classification on classes with limited available labelled samples 
- wrote simplified overview of problem statement and workings of FSL algorithm

Challenges


Learning Points
- FSL leverages on CNN to train the model, hence it is not too dissimilar in terms of steps and techniques involved. However, it is still slightly more complex. Thus, a starting point would be to simply create a CNN to classify some readily available dataset before adapting the code to FSL.
