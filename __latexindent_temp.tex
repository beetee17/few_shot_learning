\section{Problem statement}
    Few Shot Learning (FSL) is a sub-area of machine learning (ML) that 
    can be used in Computer Vision  tasks, such as image classification.
    Unlike traditional ML algorithms that work on large datasets, FSL is designed to classify images 
    (recognise objects) with few data samples.
